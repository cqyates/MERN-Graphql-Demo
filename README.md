## Big Picture

This set up guide is aimed at new coders and bootcamp students.  It represents the starting steps to get a basic MERN application with user signup, login, logout.  As well as some basic forms and features that solve the most common problems.  In the end, it should be a solid example that you can use to start your project.  It has been my recent experience that the downside of the new awesome auto complete and AI technologies is that I see a lot of perfect code that doesn't run.  Sometimes it is because the example is using one package version and the package.json file has a different package, other times the variables the auto complete is using varies from team member to team member causing chaos with each push.  Missing installation steps and confusion about what goes in the client and server cause unnessacary headaches for students and young developers.  By creating a solid base code, tested at crucial key points and deploying that code early, we can avoid most problems.  The rest of the issues that plague bootcamp students can be solved by good branching habits.

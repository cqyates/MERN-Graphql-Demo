## Big Picture

This set up guide is aimed at new coders and bootcamp students.  It represents the starting steps to get a basic MERN application with user signup, login, logout.  As well as some basic forms and features that solve the most common problems.  In the end, it should be a solid example that you can use to start your project.  It has been my recent experience that the downside of the new awesome auto complete and AI technologies is that I see a lot of perfect code that doesn't run.  Sometimes it is because the example is using one package version and the package.json file has a different package, other times the variables the auto complete is using varies from team member to team member causing chaos with each push.  Missing installation steps and confusion about what goes in the client and server cause unnessacary headaches for students and young developers.  By creating a solid base code, tested at crucial key points and deploying that code early, we can avoid most problems.  The rest of the issues that plague bootcamp students can be solved by good branching habits.

## How to Use This Guide

As you use this code, follow these simple strategies:
1. Code along with me through each step. The goal is to get the code to a running state and never push up broken or untested code.
2. When you see the KEY POINT FLAG; make sure that your code runs as expected and matches my code.
3. Checkout Branches that match my naming conventions.  Branches will be named for the job they are going to do and closed and pulled into the main.  We will never push up broken or untested code.
4. Markdown Guides will be divided by the same branch names.  Please read the overview at the top before you code along with me.
5. When you copy and paste, never copy and paste a whole repository.  Copy the command, run the command, copy the function, edit the function, run the function.
6. Deploy as early as possible.
7. If you have different results as you run the code, please submit an issue and we will bring that problem and it's solution into this repository.
8. Get that code running and keep it running.  Address each error and problem as it occurs, console.log everything!
9. Make your you understand why your code works or doesn't.  Read the markdown guides for explanations for each action we take.
10. Respect the order.  It can be tempting to want to start with the part you like best, or the part that seems the easiest.  Use the path!
